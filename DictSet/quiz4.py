# For this exercise, imagine you're working on a retail web site.
# Customers can favourite certain items that they're interested in.
# They can also purchase items, by adding them to their shopping basket â€“ or cart.
# As they browse the various items for sale, the web page will display a list of items that they might be interested in purchasing. 
# That list will be the items they've marked as "favourites'.
# But we don't want to suggest items that the customer has already added to their shopping basket.
# The code to create the favourites and basket sets has already been written and tested.
# Your task is to create a sorted list of the customer's favourite items, without any items that are in their basket.
# You must call your list suggestions. That's the name that the on-line code checker will be looking for.
# Also, don't change the names of the two sets that we've created for you.
